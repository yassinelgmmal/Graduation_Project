    "# PEGASUS Fine-tuning for Document Metadata → Abstract Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a clean and efficient pipeline for fine-tuning Google's **PEGASUS** model on scientific papers from arXiv. The pipeline focuses on **abstract generation from document metadata** where the model learns to generate complete abstracts from paper metadata (title, authors, categories, etc.) without seeing the target abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PEGASUS Model**: State-of-the-art for document summarization with excellent efficiency\n",
    "2. **Metadata-to-Abstract**: Document metadata → Complete abstract generation (no abstract in input)\n",
    "3. **Clean Architecture**: Streamlined code without unnecessary complexity\n",
    "4. **100-Paper Dataset**: 400/50/50 train/validation/test split\n",
    "5. **Real Evaluation**: ROUGE metrics on actual generated abstracts\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Model Choice: PEGASUS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PEGASUS** is specifically designed for abstractive summarization\n",
    "- **Superior Architecture** optimized for abstractive summarization\n",
    "- **Pre-trained on Scientific Papers** making it ideal for arXiv content\n",
    "- **Efficient** with transformer architecture optimized for summarization\n",
    "- **Proven Performance** on summarization benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: Document\n",
    "- **Target**: Complete original abstracts\n",
    "- **Goal**: Learn to generate informative abstracts from paper metadata alone"

      "Summary: i present a predictive analysis for the behavior of the far - infrared ( fir)radio correlation as a function of redshift in light of the deep radio continuum surveys which may become possible using the square kilometer array ( ska ) . to keep a fixed ratio between the fir and predominantly non - thermal radio continuum emission of a normal star - forming galaxy , whose cosmic - ray ( cr ) electrons typically lose most of their energy to synchrotron radiation and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering , requires a nearly constant ratio between galaxy magnetic field and radiation field energy densities . while the additional term of ic losses off of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is negligible in the local universe , the rapid increase in the strength of the cmb energy density ( i.e. xmath0 suggests that evolution in the fir - radio correlation should occur with infrared ( ir ; xmath1)radio ratios increasing with redshift . this signature should be especially apparent once beyond xmath2 where the magnetic field of a normal star - forming galaxy must be xmath350 xmath4 g to save the fir - radio correlation . at present , observations do not show such a trend with redshift ; xmath5 radio - quiet quasars appear to lie on the local fir - radio correlation while a sample of xmath6 and xmath7 submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) exhibit ratios that are a factor of xmath32.5 _ below _ the canonical value . i also derive a 5xmath8 point - source sensitivity goal of xmath920 njy ( i.e. xmath10 njy ) requiring that the ska specified be xmath11 mxmath12 kxmath13 ; achieving this sensitivity should enable the detection of galaxies forming stars at a rate of xmath14 , such as typical luminous infrared galaxies ( i.e. xmath15 ) , at all redshifts if present . by taking advantage of the fact that the non - thermal component of a galaxy s radio continuum emission will be quickly suppressed by ic losses off of the cmb , leaving only the thermal ( free - free ) component , i argue that deep radio continuum surveys at frequencies xmath1610 ghz may prove to be the best probe for characterizing the high-xmath17 star formation history of the universe unbiased by dust ....\n",
